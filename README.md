# Zekecato.com based on WordPress starter for Gridsome

## Dynamic Pages

Main pages are all pulled from Wordpress and displayed in the navbar.

## Where's my index.vue?

Currently the home path is configured in gridsome.config.js to point to the about page. I am opting to manage all pages and page content through the Wordpress CMS unless there is real need for customization beyond the default layout.

## Package Management

Use Yarn.
