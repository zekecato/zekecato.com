        Sometimes, you just need a hint here and there. Sometimes, you just need
        that question answered that doesn't make sense for a whole consulting
        session. Sometimes, you just want a way to absolve your guilt for asking
        that
        feels-kinda-silly-to-ask-but-how-would-you-know-unless-you-had-done-this-specific-thing-before
        question.

      <h3>
        That's why I created Tips For Tips!
      </h3>
      <p>
        It's my desire to keep researching topics, learning new skills, and
        helping my community with technology, chemistry, instructional videos or
        whatever! If I've created value in your life with my top-notch (and
        competitively priced) advice, show your support and keep me in the biz
        by leaving me a tip below.
